## Introduction

Clerk is a developer-first authentication and user management solution. It provides pre-built React components and hooks for sign-in, sign-up, user profile, and organization management. Clerk is designed to be easy to use and customize, and can be dropped into any React or Next.js application.

After following the quickstart you'll have learned how to:

- Install `@clerk/clerk-expo`
- Setup your environment key
- Wrap your Expo app in `<ClerkProvider />` and supply your `tokenCache`
- Conditionally show content based on your auth state
- Build your sign-in and sign-up pages

### Branches of this repository

- `main`: The result of following the [Clerk Expo quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/expo).
- `advanced`: A more advanced version of the quickstart, with OAuth connections, error handling and styling.

## Running the template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clerk/clerk-expo-quickstart
```

1. Sign up for a Clerk account at [https://clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up?utm_source=DevRel&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=templates&utm_content=10-24-2023&utm_term=clerk-expo-quickstart).

3. Set the required Clerk environment variable as shown in [the example `env` file](./.env.example).

4. `npm install` the required dependencies.

5. `npm run start` to launch the development server.
